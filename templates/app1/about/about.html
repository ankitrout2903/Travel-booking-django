            <h3>How does it work</h3>
            <p>We make a proposal based on a rough sketch of the region you wish to visit and the available time. If you already know exactly where you want to go, let us know and we will make a proposal for the route. It is usually not necessary to book hotels in advance. There are almost always rooms available in the desired hotel class. That gives you the freedom to stay somewhere a little longer or to continue traveling a day earlier.</p>
